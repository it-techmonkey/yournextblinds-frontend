// Selectable size range for this product family, taken directly from the supplier
// catalogue's "Size Considerations for All Shades" table
// (HoneyComb_ProductCatalog_032626.pdf, p.1): min width 9" (Cordless), max width 96"
// (107" is offered via Special Quote in the doc — not reachable here, since this
// instant-quote flow has no special-quote path), min height 18", max height 120".
//
// This range is WIDER than the price grid's own coverage (24-96"W x 36-96"H, the 12
// groups in pricing-data.json). That is intentional and safe: ProductPage bypasses
// the price-matrix-derived `sizeRanges` for Honeycomb Cellular specifically so these
// bounds always win, and any size outside the grid is still priced correctly by the
// existing ceiling logic — findCeilingWidthBand/findCeilingHeightBand (client:
// src/lib/pricing.ts, server: src/lib/server/pricing.service.ts) round UP to the
// smallest available band for a too-small size, and fall back to the LARGEST band's
// price for a too-large one. So e.g. a 9"-wide order prices at the 24" rate, and a
// 120"-tall order prices at the 96" rate — never undercharged, just not a bespoke
// per-size price for the sizes the supplier hasn't priced individually.
