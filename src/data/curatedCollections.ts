// Curated Collections
// ============================================
// Cross-cutting landing pages (window type / feature / room) that cannot be
// expressed by the one-category-plus-tags model in navigation.ts, because a
// single page needs products from several Shopify collections at once
// (e.g. "Bedroom" = blackout verticals OR rollers OR zebra shades).
//
// Each definition owns everything about its page: identity, copy, hero image,
// nav presentation, and the rule that selects its products — deliberately one
// object per collection rather than the parallel Record<> maps in navigation.ts.
//
// Selection is hybrid. If `tagSlug` is set and ANY product in the catalog
// carries that tag, the tag wins outright and `include` is ignored. That means
// adding a real `bedroom` tag in Shopify later takes over automatically with no
// code change. Until then, the `include` rules below keep every page populated.

 * condition present on it holds.
